Instructions

For assignment 1, complete the following tasks

* Add your name and today's date up at the top of this file * Install the `palmerpenguins` package, unless you've already installed it, by clicking the yellow message at the top of the editing window, or using the Tools > Install packages... menu
* Familiarize yourself with the `penguins` dataset in the next section.
* Draw a plot and refine it twice using the methods from Lesson 5 Making your first plot as directed below
* Before knitting this file, make sure for each figure to:
-describe the figure you plan to show, 
-show your R code for the figure
-show the output of your R code
-say a sentence or 2 about each figure (interpretation)

Your report should

## Look at the data

Here is a condensed overview of the `penguins` data

```{r}
str(penguins)
```
and an overview of the `penguins_raw` supplementary data.

```{r}
str(penguins_raw)
```

We will use the penguins dataset.

## New visualization

### Step 1 (3 pts)

<!--

q1.1

Write a R code (1 line) that print the names of the columns of the penguins dataset. [0.5 pts]

-->


```{r}
print(names(palmerpenguins::penguins))
```


<!--

q1.2

Create a scatterplot of bill length (on the x axis) and bill depth (on the y axis).  Make the simplest plot you can, using just `ggplot`, `aes` and `geom_point`. [1.5 pts]

-->
This plot will show the range between Bill Lenght and Bill Depth for Palmer Penguins Data.


```{r}
ggplot(palmerpenguins::penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
```


<!--
q1.3

Write 1 sentence that describes what you see (or do not see)  in your plot [1 pt]
--> The range of results varies substantially, the lack of color makes it hard to make correlations or read the info clearly.

### Step 2 (2 pts)

<!--
q2.1

Refine your previous plot, adding colour or shape to indicate the species. Just do the minimal change. (2 pts)
-->
This plot will show the range of bill depth and length for Palmer Pengui Data while also highlighting which data correspond to what species of penguin using color.

```{r}
ggplot(palmerpenguins::penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```


<!--

q2.2

The addition of color and a legend of species, makes the plot easier to understand and points out the difference in range between species.
-->


### Step 3 (2 pts)

<!--

q3.1

Refine your plot by adding informative and readable axis labels and a brief title for the plot.
-->
This plot will include a new title and axis labels  for the Palmer Penguin Data,

```{r}
ggplot(palmerpenguins::penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() +
 labs( 
x = "Bill Lenght (mm)",
y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
title = "Bill Dimensions of Penguin and Their Species"
)
```


## Another comparison 
The addition of title and axis labels gives a better idea as to what the data is representing.
<!--

q4 (2 pts)

Make any additional plot of your choice to illustrate another aspect of the comparison of penguins morphologies across species 
-->
This will change the background and data point so they are more prominent.

```{r}
ggplot(palmerpenguins::penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() +
 labs( 
x = "Bill Lenght (mm)",
y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
title = "Bill Dimensions of Penguin and Their Species"
) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This allows for the data points to be visualized more clearly by making it more minimalist.
<!--

q5 Knit and submit Rmd+pdf (1 pt)

Knit your work to pdf (click "knit" in the menu just at the top of the editing window).

If knitting does not work, spot the line with an error, fix the error in your Rmd file, then reknit. Iterate this procedure until until there are no errors and knitting finishes.

If knitting to pdf does not work, knit to html, load the html in your web browser and use the print function of your browser to print your html file 'as pdf'.

Once done, upload two files, (one after the other): your Rmd file and the knitted pdf.

DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE your name and banner id in the header of this file, but do NOT mess up the header!

Pushing your report to github [Unmarked but do it!]

Stage, commit and push your final .Rmd and your .html file to your GitHub repository (as done in W2 task number 3- see instructions on Brightspace>Week 2).
